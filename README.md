Road Accident Dashboard
Overview
This project is a Tableau Dashboard focused on analyzing and visualizing road accident data. The goal is to provide insights into accident trends, patterns, and key factors such as location, time of day, weather conditions, and types of vehicles involved.

Dashboard Features
Accident Frequency Analysis: Displays the number of accidents over time, showing peaks and trends.
Geographical Visualization: Maps out accident hotspots, helping identify high-risk areas.
Accident Severity Breakdown: Categorizes accidents based on severity, ranging from minor injuries to fatalities.
Time-Based Analysis: Visualizes accidents by time of day and day of the week to understand when accidents are most likely to occur.
Contributing Factors: Shows the key factors (e.g., weather, vehicle type, road condition) associated with accidents.
Data
The dashboard is based on a dataset containing detailed road accident information. The dataset includes variables such as:

Date and time of the accident
Location (latitude, longitude, city, region)
Severity level
Weather conditions at the time of the accident
Vehicle types involved
How to Use the Dashboard
You can explore the dashboard by interacting with the different visualizations. Filters allow you to drill down into specific regions, time periods, and other factors for a more detailed analysis.

Project Purpose
This dashboard aims to:

Help policymakers and city planners identify dangerous areas and times to implement safety measures.
Provide data-driven insights for improving road safety and reducing accidents.
Assist in educating the public on the common causes of accidents.
Future Enhancements
Incorporating predictive analytics to forecast accident occurrences based on historical data.
Adding additional filters and interaction features to make the dashboard more customizable.
